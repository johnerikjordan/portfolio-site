                                Simultaneously with my workflow simplification, the backend team refactored API endpoints to increase capacity. Their changes made my inline product addition technically possible—but had an unforeseen side effect. The entire platform ground to a halt.

                            <p><strong>Perfect timing:</strong> The PM left (replacement not starting for 3 months), and the QA engineer went on maternity leave (cover starting in 2 weeks). For two weeks, I was the only person who could keep the product on track.</p>

                        <h4>1. Domain complexity requires deep research</h4>
                        <p>
                            Users didn't know what they needed because they'd never seen an alternative to email/PDF chaos. Ethnographic site visits revealed the real workflow pain points that interviews alone wouldn't have caught.

                        <h4>2. Versatility matters in small teams</h4>
                        <p>
                            When PM and QA were both unavailable, the product didn't stop. I researched analytics tools, co-ran sprints, prioritized tickets, and kept development moving—proving I could wear multiple hats when needed.

                        <h4>3. Data breaks stalemates</h4>
                        <p>
                            "The backend is fine" vs. "users say it's slow" was an unsolvable argument until Sentry provided objective metrics. Sometimes the designer's job is identifying what data you need, not just designing interfaces.

                        <p>
                            Getting to parity (15 min task time) felt like success, but the real win was exceeding analog (10 min). Digital transformation only works when it's genuinely better than the old way.

                        <p>
                            The 3-month PM gap could have derailed the product. Instead, it proved I could handle strategic product work—feature prioritization, sprint planning, stakeholder communication—while maintaining design quality.

                    This project taught me that being a "sole designer" in a startup doesn't mean just making things pretty—it means being a problem-solver who can identify what's needed and find a way to deliver it, even when it falls outside traditional design scope.
