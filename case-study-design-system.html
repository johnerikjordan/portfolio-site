                <p class="reframe-text">
                    When I joined STRATO as Lead UI Designer in May 2023, the design team of six was drowning in inefficiency. Every designer had their own way of organizing components—some maintained personal master files, others created new files for every ticket. Three partially-finished pattern libraries sat deprecated and unmaintained, abandoned the moment they were "finished."

                <p class="reframe-text">
                    My predecessors had tried to solve this with documentation—style guides, pattern libraries, usage instructions. But manual documentation fell out of date immediately. What we needed wasn't more documentation; we needed a system that <strong>enforced consistency automatically</strong> and <strong>adapted to different technical requirements without manual intervention.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="reframe-text">
                    The breakthrough came from timing: STRATO had just fully migrated to Figma, and Figma was about to release the tool we needed.

                <h3 class="proposal-title">Research & Vision</h3>
                <p class="reframe-text">
                    Even before starting at STRATO, I'd been researching design tokens and their potential to transform productivity. During my interviews, I talked about this vision with the design team—and I could see that two designers (David Dutschke and Chris Stüberitz, both juniors interested in code) were energized by the idea.
                </p>
                <p class="reframe-text">
                    The timing was perfect: STRATO had just fully migrated to Figma, giving us—for the first time—a single platform where all designers could collaborate.
                </p>

                <h3 class="proposal-title" style="margin-top: var(--space-xl);">The Missing Piece</h3>
                <p class="reframe-text">
                    Initially, we planned to use a third-party plugin for design tokens. But between our first and second workshop with engineers, <strong>Figma released Variables</strong>—their native design tokens implementation. This was the breakthrough we needed: a scalable, Figma-native solution that could serve multiple tech stacks from a single source of truth.

                                Not everyone was convinced. Some engineers remembered past abandoned attempts at design systems and were skeptical this would be any different. But I didn't need everyone on board—I only needed <strong>one point of contact per engineering team</strong> for the project to get started. The skeptics came around when they saw their colleagues' support for the project and monthly progress demonstrations.

                            Then we hit a coordination bottleneck: trying to consolidate components across platforms with all six designers was too slow. I reduced the core design system team to three (myself, David, and Chris) so we could move faster.

                                Parallel to this project, we were preparing for the European Accessibility Act (June 2026 deadline).

                                The design system was never anyone's main project. All three of us still had regular design duties in our respective product streams. This constant time and resource pressure meant we had to be strategic: <strong>we used the highest-priority sprint deliverables to determine what to refactor in the design system next.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-top: var(--space-sm);">
                                For example, when the web portal team needed to migrate to a new CMS, they had to refactor price card components. Price cards appeared prominently on every product offer page in comparison carousels. That external pressure became a perfect opportunity to focus on the complex UI of nested components as a design system priority.

                                This "zigzag path" kept the design system relevant and useful instead of becoming an ivory tower project.
