                    Smart Agency was an ambitious spin-off of the Marketing Agency TERRITORY, creating a 
                    platform for small businesses to automate their marketing with AI. I joined shortly 
                    before the product went live, but I saw three major flaws with the MVP that was 
                    about to be released.

                        those problems, so expecting users to provide payment details (even with a 
                        free first month) was not going to work.

                                The main USP on the Smart Agency website and in marketing campaigns stated: 
                                "GENERATE YOUR COMPANY WEBSITE IN MINUTES," so users expected to see their 
                                website after answering all the briefing questions. Seeing a brand book instead 
                                felt to them like a bait and switch.

                                <li>The freemium model allows a user to access the platform quickly, after 
                                    a short account creation process. The platform itself becomes a marketing 
                                    tool, as users see the value of basic features for themselves, but also 
                                    see what more can be unlocked with a paid plan</li>

                            real-world data from launch can reframe the conversation entirely.

                            creates an insurmountable barrier. Show first, ask later.
